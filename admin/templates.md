  Learn how to create an embeddable "Open In Coder" button for your Workspaces

The **Templates** tab features options that control the behavior of workspace
templates.

The **Enable using Workspace Templates** toggle allows you to enable or disable
the creation of [workspaces](../workspaces/index.md) using predefined templates
located in Git repositories.

## Template policy (alpha)

If you enable the use of workspace templates, a **template policy** allows you
to control which fields users can set and which values can be used when they
define their workspaces.

The default template policy is as follows:

```yaml
version: "0.2"
workspace:
    configure:
        start:
            policy: write
    dev-urls:
        policy: write
    specs:
        kubernetes:
            container-based-vm:
                policy: write
            cpu:
                policy: write
            disk:
                policy: write
            env:
                policy: write
            gpu-count:
                policy: write
            image:
                policy: write
            labels:
                policy: read
            memory:
                policy: write
            node-selector:
                policy: read
            tolerations:
                policy: read
```

Underneath the policy template preview, you can either upload your policy or you
can drag-and-drop the file onto the UI. Click **Save** to persist your changes.

If, at any time, you want to remove your policy and use Coder's default policy,
click **Reset to default**.

## Embeddable Button

The Embeddable Button section features a form you can use for generating an embeddable
button. This button makes it easy for developers to use your
[workspace template](../workspaces/workspaces-as-code/index.md).

To create your button:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Admin** > **Templates**.
1. Fill out the fields.

Once you've filled out the form, Coder generates a custom Markdown snippet,
which you can then add to your repository's `README.md`.

## Enabling workspaces as code

By default, workspaces as code is an opt-in feature. To enable workspaces as
code, go to **Admin > Templates** and set **Enable using Workspace Templates**
to **On**.
