## Release schedule

[Coder release calendar (iCal file)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_sdmrh87t5voc4u5rrjvktcrpko%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

- We typically issue release _candidates_ on the **third Wednesday** of each
  month, though this is subject to change. Check the
  [release calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_sdmrh87t5voc4u5rrjvktcrpko%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)
  for up-to-date information (Coder may create multiple release candidates prior
  to the actual release)
  - We do not provide documentation for release candidates, and you should not
    use them unless you've been instructed to do so by Coder. You can identify
    release candidates by the presence of `-rc` in the version number (e.g.,
    `1.16.0-rc.1`).
- Releases are available a week after we issue a release candidate
- _Patch_ releases become available as needed
