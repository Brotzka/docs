### Breaking changes ❗

- infra: Removed `tolerations` from workspaces as code templates.

### Features ✨

- web: Added a toggle to enable/disable workspaces as code on the **Manage >
  Admin > Templates** page. Disabling workspaces as code has the following
  impact:
  - New workspaces cannot be created from a template.
  - Existing workspaces built from a template will continue to operate and may
    be rebuilt. These workspaces will still be notified of changes to remote
    templates.
- infra: Added beta support for NVIDIA GPUs in environments created as
  container-based virtual machines (CVMs).
  - NVIDIA GPUs can be added to container-based virtual machines (CVMs) on bare
    metal clusters. GKE and other cloud providers are currently not supported
    at this time.
- web: Environments can now be created with multiple GPUs (maximum number of
  GPUs: 20).

### Bug fixes 🐛

- web: Fixed **Application** icons appearing broken and the **workspace provider
  ping indicator** remaining in an error state. The underlying cause was a
  malformed _envproxy_access_url_ on `built-in` workspace providers.
- web: Fixed an issue causing workspace providers to incorrectly appear in an
  error state on the **Manage > Admin > Workspace Providers** page.
